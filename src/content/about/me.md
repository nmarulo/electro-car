### Mauricio Marulanda L.

My beginnings in **Car-Audio** date back to 1994, at first I took it as a _hobbie_, little by little my friends
recommended me to more people and I saw the need to train as a technician.

**I studied electricity and electronics**, complementing it with courses in professional installation, audio tuning,
fiberglass work with leatherette finishes and painting.

I then trained as a sound judge for **IASCA**, and later as an **EMMA** judge.

Wanting to expand my field of knowledge, in 2012 I took a course in automotive electromechanics, and currently I am
self-employed, repairing electrical and electronic breakdowns in cars, also vehicle air conditioning systems.
